The variables I consider possibly left censored are **feat10**, **feat34**, **feat44**, **feat46**, **feat59**, **feat60**, **feat65**, **feat73**, **feat77**

Those that are possibly right-censored are **feat26**, **feat27**, **feat28**, **feat45**, **feat53**, **feat54**, **feat61**, **feat67**, **feat78**, 

Some variables also look to be censored on both the left and right side. These are **feat3**, **feat68**, 

Others that may be censored in some other way are **feat11**, **feat13**, **feat14**, **feat15**, **feat20**, **feat21**, **feat37**, **feat38**, **feat39**, **feat40**, **feat41**, **feat42**, **feat62**, **feat63**, **feat72**, **feat74**
